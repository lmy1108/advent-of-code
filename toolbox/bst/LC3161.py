Your intuition is correct in principle, but there are a few key details and optimizations you might be missing that are crucial for solving this problem efficiently, especially given the constraints. Let’s break it down step by step and address what you might have missed.

What You’re Missing
Efficient Storage of Obstacles:

If you use a simple array to store obstacles, checking for the largest gap between obstacles (or between 0 and the first obstacle, or between the last obstacle and x) will take O(n) time per query, where n is the number of obstacles. This is too slow for the given constraints (queries.length <= 15 * 10^4).

Handling Queries Efficiently:

For each query of type 2, you need to quickly determine if there’s a gap of size sz in the range [0, x]. This requires efficient data structures to handle the obstacles and answer queries in sublinear time.

Edge Cases:

You need to handle edge cases, such as:

No obstacles in the range [0, x].

Obstacles at the boundaries (e.g., 0 or x).

Multiple obstacles close together, leaving no room for the block.

Optimal Approach
To handle this problem efficiently, we need a data structure that allows us to:

Insert obstacles (type 1 queries) in logarithmic time.

Query the largest gap (type 2 queries) in logarithmic time.

A sorted data structure like a balanced binary search tree (BST) or a sorted list (e.g., using Python’s bisect module) is ideal for this purpose. Here’s how it works:

Step-by-Step Solution
1. Data Structure
Use a sorted list (e.g., sortedcontainers.SortedList in Python) to store the positions of obstacles. This allows for efficient insertion and querying.

2. Handling Type 1 Queries
For a query [1, x], insert x into the sorted list. This ensures that the obstacles are always in sorted order.

3. Handling Type 2 Queries
For a query [2, x, sz], we need to check if there’s a gap of size sz in the range [0, x]. Here’s how:

Find the leftmost obstacle greater than or equal to x using binary search.

Find the rightmost obstacle less than or equal to 0 using binary search.

Iterate through the obstacles in the range [0, x] and calculate the gaps between consecutive obstacles.

Also, check the gaps between 0 and the first obstacle, and between the last obstacle and x.

If any gap is greater than or equal to sz, return true. Otherwise, return false.

Example Walkthrough
Example 1
Input: queries = [[1,2],[2,3,3],[2,3,1],[2,2,2]]

Query 0: [1,2]

Insert 2 into the sorted list. Obstacles: [2].

Query 1: [2,3,3]

Check for a gap of size 3 in [0,3].

Obstacles in [0,3]: [2].

Gaps:

Between 0 and 2: size 2 (not enough).

Between 2 and 3: size 1 (not enough).

No gap of size 3 → Return false.

Query 2: [2,3,1]

Check for a gap of size 1 in [0,3].

Obstacles in [0,3]: [2].

Gaps:

Between 0 and 2: size 2 (enough).

Gap of size 2 exists → Return true.

Query 3: [2,2,2]

Check for a gap of size 2 in [0,2].

Obstacles in [0,2]: [2].

Gaps:

Between 0 and 2: size 2 (enough).

Gap of size 2 exists → Return true.

Output: [false, true, true]

Edge Cases
No Obstacles:

If there are no obstacles in [0, x], the entire range [0, x] is available. Check if x >= sz.

Obstacles at Boundaries:

If an obstacle is at 0 or x, ensure the block doesn’t overlap with it.

Multiple Obstacles Close Together:

Ensure that the gaps between consecutive obstacles are checked correctly.

Optimized Code
Here’s how you can implement this efficiently in Python using the bisect module:
'''


from bisect import bisect_left, bisect_right

def processQueries(queries):
    obstacles = []  # Sorted list of obstacles
    results = []
    
    for query in queries:
        if query[0] == 1:
            # Type 1 query: Insert obstacle
            x = query[1]
            idx = bisect_left(obstacles, x)
            if idx == len(obstacles) or obstacles[idx] != x:
                obstacles.insert(idx, x)
        else:
            # Type 2 query: Check for a gap of size sz
            x, sz = query[1], query[2]
            if sz > x:
                results.append(False)
                continue
            
            # Find obstacles in [0, x]
            left = bisect_left(obstacles, 0)
            right = bisect_right(obstacles, x)
            relevant_obstacles = obstacles[left:right]
            
            # Check gaps
            prev = 0
            for obstacle in relevant_obstacles:
                gap = obstacle - prev
                if gap >= sz:
                    results.append(True)
                    break
                prev = obstacle
            else:
                # Check the last gap between the last obstacle and x
                if x - prev >= sz:
                    results.append(True)
                else:
                    results.append(False)
    
    return results
