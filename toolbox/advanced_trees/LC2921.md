**Analysis**

We want three indices \((i, j, k)\) with \(i < j < k\) such that

\[
\text{prices}[i] < \text{prices}[j] < \text{prices}[k]
\]

and we want to maximize

\[
\text{profits}[i] + \text{profits}[j] + \text{profits}[k].
\]

A direct brute force approach (\(O(n^3)\)) is obviously too large for \(n\) up to 50,000. Instead, a common trick is to fix the **middle** index \(j\). Then:

1. We want to know the **best** (maximum-profit) item \(i\) to the **left** of \(j\) with \(\text{prices}[i] < \text{prices}[j]\).
2. We want to know the **best** (maximum-profit) item \(k\) to the **right** of \(j\) with \(\text{prices}[k] > \text{prices}[j]\).

Once we have:

- \(\text{left\_max}[j]\) = maximum \(\text{profits}[i]\) over all \(i < j\) with \(\text{prices}[i] < \text{prices}[j]\)
- \(\text{right\_max}[j]\) = maximum \(\text{profits}[k]\) over all \(k > j\) with \(\text{prices}[k] > \text{prices}[j]\)

Then for each \(j\), a candidate answer is:

\[
\text{left\_max}[j] + \text{profits}[j] + \text{right\_max}[j].
\]

We take the maximum of this over all \(j\). If no valid triple is found, we return \(-1\).

### How to Compute \(\text{left\_max}\) Efficiently

\[
\text{left\_max}[j] = \max\{\text{profits}[i] \mid i < j \text{ and } \text{prices}[i] < \text{prices}[j]\}.
\]

Since \(\text{prices}[i]\) can go up to 5000, we can use a Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) or a Segment Tree keyed by the **price**. For a Fenwick tree supporting **maximum** queries:

- We will store, in Fenwick\_tree[p], the maximum profit of any item that has price = p.
- To get the max profit among all prices strictly less than \(p\), we will query Fenwick up to \(p-1\).

In pseudocode (left to right):

```
Initialize Fenwick BIT array of size 5001 to 0  # prices range 1..5000
left_max = array of size n

for j in [0..n-1]:
    price_j = prices[j]
    # query the max profit among all prices < price_j
    best_left_profit = fenwicks_query(BIT, price_j - 1)
    left_max[j] = best_left_profit

    # then update the Fenwick tree with the profit at the current price
    fenwicks_update(BIT, price_j, profits[j])
```

Here:
- `fenwicks_query(BIT, x)` = maximum profit among all indices \(\le x\).
- `fenwicks_update(BIT, p, val)` = set the Fenwick structure so that the maximum at price `p` takes into account `val`.

If `price_j` is 1, then `price_j - 1 = 0`, so we query up to 0 which should return 0 (meaning no valid left candidate). If `left_max[j]` remains `0`, it means no valid \(i\) was found for index `j`.

---

### How to Compute \(\text{right\_max}\) Efficiently

\[
\text{right\_max}[j] = \max\{\text{profits}[k] \mid k > j \text{ and } \text{prices}[k] > \text{prices}[j]\}.
\]

We can do a similar Fenwick approach, but we have to build it **from right to left**. We again store profits in a Fenwick keyed by the price, but now:

- When we are at index `j` going from right to left, we want to query **all prices strictly greater** than `prices[j]`.

A typical Fenwick tree gives us prefix maxima (or sums). To get suffix maxima easily, we can do one of two things:

1. **Use a Segment Tree** over prices `[1..5000]` and query the range `[price_j+1..5000]`.  
   or
2. **Use a Fenwick Tree with reversed indexing** so that a Fenwick prefix query in that reversed domain corresponds to a suffix in the normal domain.

A simpler conceptual approach is:

- Iterate `j` from `n-1` down to `0`.
- To get max among prices > `prices[j]`, we do a Fenwick query on the range `[prices[j]+1..5000]`.
- Then update the Fenwick at `prices[j]`.

Since Fenwicks typically give prefix queries from `1..x`, to get a suffix `[p+1..5000]`, we can do either:

- A segment tree for direct range queries, or
- A "reversed" Fenwick approach.  

**Reversed Fenwick** trick:

- Store items at index `rev = 5001 - price`.  
- Then "prefix" in `rev` corresponds to "suffix" in normal price space.  

Below is a standard pattern (just be careful with indexing off-by-1).  

Pseudocode (right to left with reversed Fenwicks):

```
Initialize Fenwicks BIT array of size 5001 to 0
right_max = array of size n

for j in [n-1..0]:
    p = prices[j]
    # We want max in [p+1..5000].
    # The "reversed" index for a price q is rev(q) = 5001 - q.
    # The suffix [p+1..5000] in normal domain corresponds to
    # rev range [rev(5000)..rev(p+1)] in reversed domain = [1.. 5001-(p+1)] 
    # which is [1.. (5000 - p)].

    # Let's define a helper:
    #   rev_price = 5001 - p
    # Then to get the max in the range [p+1..5000],
    # we want fenwicks_query( (5001 - (p+1)) ), 
    # i.e. fenwicks_query(5000 - p)

    revP = 5001 - p
    if p < 5000:
        right_max[j] = fenwicks_query(BIT, 5000 - p)
    else:
        # p == 5000 => no strictly larger price => right_max[j] = 0
        right_max[j] = 0

    # now update for the current price p
    # we store profits[j] at index = revP = 5001 - p
    fenwicks_update(BIT, revP, profits[j])
```

If `right_max[j]` = 0, it means there is no valid \(k\) to the right of `j` with a strictly larger price.

---

### Combine for the Final Answer

At the end, we have:

- `left_max[j]`: best profit of an item on the left with a smaller price than `prices[j]`
- `profits[j]`
- `right_max[j]`: best profit of an item on the right with a bigger price than `prices[j]`

We compute:

```
best = -1
for j in range(n):
    if left_max[j] > 0 and right_max[j] > 0:  # means both sides are feasible
        candidate = left_max[j] + profits[j] + right_max[j]
        best = max(best, candidate)

return best
```

If `best` remains `-1`, that means we never found a valid triple.

## Full Python Implementation

Below is a clean solution using two Fenwicks (one forward, one reversed).  
Remember that all `prices[i] >= 1`, so Fenwicks are 1-based.  
Also note \( \max(\text{prices}[i]) \le 5000\), so Fenwicks of size 5001 are sufficient.

```python
def solve(prices, profits):
    n = len(prices)
    MAX_P = 5000
    
    # Fenwicks (BIT) for maximum queries: 1..MAX_P
    # We'll define standard Fenwicks routines for "max".
    
    def fenwicks_update(BIT, idx, val):
        while idx <= MAX_P:
            BIT[idx] = max(BIT[idx], val)
            idx += idx & -idx
    
    def fenwicks_query(BIT, idx):
        # max in [1..idx]
        result = 0
        while idx > 0:
            result = max(result, BIT[idx])
            idx -= idx & -idx
        return result
    
    # 1) Compute left_max
    left_max = [0]*n
    BIT_left = [0]*(MAX_P+1)  # Fenwicks for forward pass
    
    for j in range(n):
        p = prices[j]
        if p > 1:
            best_left = fenwicks_query(BIT_left, p-1)
        else:
            best_left = 0  # can't have smaller price if p=1
        left_max[j] = best_left
        # update Fenwicks with the profit at the current price
        fenwicks_update(BIT_left, p, profits[j])
    
    # 2) Compute right_max using "reversed Fenwicks"
    right_max = [0]*n
    BIT_right = [0]*(MAX_P+1)
    
    for j in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        p = prices[j]
        # We want the range (p+1..MAX_P), which in normal Fenwicks is not a trivial prefix.
        # Instead, do reversed indexing: index = (MAX_P+1) - price
        # Then "prefix" in reversed domain = suffix in normal domain.
        rev_idx = (MAX_P+1) - p  # 1-based index in reversed domain
        
        if p < MAX_P:
            # query for suffix p+1..MAX_P => prefix in reversed domain up to (MAX_P - p)
            # which is fenwicks_query(BIT_right, (MAX_P - p))
            right_max[j] = fenwicks_query(BIT_right, MAX_P - p)
        else:
            # p == MAX_P => no strictly larger price
            right_max[j] = 0
        
        # Now update Fenwicks in reversed domain with profits[j] at rev_idx
        fenwicks_update(BIT_right, rev_idx, profits[j])
    
    # 3) Find the best triple
    best = -1
    for j in range(n):
        # Only valid if both sides are nonzero
        if left_max[j] > 0 and right_max[j] > 0:
            candidate = left_max[j] + profits[j] + right_max[j]
            if candidate > best:
                best = candidate
    
    return best


# --------------------
# Testing with the given examples
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example 1
    prices1 = [10, 2, 3, 4]
    profits1 = [100, 2, 7, 10]
    print(solve(prices1, profits1))  # Expected 19
    
    # Example 2
    prices2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    profits2 = [1, 5, 3, 4, 6]
    print(solve(prices2, profits2))  # Expected 15
    
    # Example 3
    prices3 = [4, 3, 2, 1]
    profits3 = [33, 20, 19, 87]
    print(solve(prices3, profits3))  # Expected -1
```

**Explanation of Key Ideas:**

1. **Fenwicks Tree for Maximum**: Instead of the typical Fenwicks tree for sums, we store **maximum**. The update and query logic is the same, except we take `max` instead of adding.
2. **left\_max**: As we move left to right, `left_max[j]` is the best profit so far among all items whose price is strictly less than `prices[j]`. This is exactly `fenwicks_query(BIT_left, prices[j] - 1)`.
3. **right\_max**: As we move right to left, we do a similar trick but we need the best profit among all items whose price is strictly **greater** than `prices[j]`. We use a **reversed indexing** trick for Fenwicks so that a prefix query in the reversed domain corresponds to a suffix in the normal domain.
4. Finally, we collect the best possible sum of `left_max[j] + profits[j] + right_max[j]` over all valid `j`.

If we never find a `j` with both `left_max[j] > 0` and `right_max[j] > 0`, we return \(-1\) indicating no valid triple.

This runs in \(O(n \log P)\) where \(P = 5000\) is the maximum possible price. Since \(\log(5000)\) is small (about 12), this is efficient for \(n\) up to \(50,000\).

## Final Notes

- If *all* prices are in *descending* order, we will never find \(i<j<k\) with strictly increasing prices, so the answer is \(-1\).
- If *all* prices are in *ascending* order, then every triplet \((i, j, k)\) is valid and we effectively just pick the three largest profits. Indeed, the Fenwicks approach will yield the same result (the 3 biggest profits among all items since any triple is valid).  
- This method is a standard pattern for the “best left for \(j\)” and “best right for \(j\)” technique whenever you have the condition *strictly less (or greater)* in an array with moderate integer ranges.
