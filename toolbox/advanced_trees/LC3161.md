The statement refers to a fundamental limitation of the Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) when handling decreasing values (like splitting gaps). Here's a deeper breakdown:

BIT’s Design for Cumulative Updates
The BIT is optimized for cumulative operations (e.g., sums, maxima) where updates increase values. Its structure allows propagating updates upward efficiently using i += i & -i:

When you add a value to a position, the BIT updates all indices that include that position in their range.

For example, adding 3 to index 2 in a sum-BIT propagates this change to indices 2 → 4 → 8 → ....

The Problem with "Downgrading"
When splitting a gap into smaller gaps (e.g., adding an obstacle), you need to replace a large maximum value with smaller ones. This is inefficient for two reasons:

1. BIT’s Inability to Track Previous States
The BIT stores the current maximum at each index. If you split a gap of size 5 into 2 and 3, the BIT has no memory that the 5 existed. You must manually:

Remove the old maximum (5).

Insert the new maxima (2 and 3).

This requires traversing the BIT to "undo" the old maximum, which is not natively supported.

2. Cost of Recomputing Maxima
Splitting a gap requires recomputing the maximum for all affected ranges. For example:

Original gap: [0, 9] (size 9).

Split into [0, 2] (size 2) and [2, 9] (size 7).

The BIT must now replace 9 with 7 (at index 9) and add 2 (at index 2).

Propagating these changes requires multiple O(log n) operations, which is slower than a single update.

Example: Splitting vs. Merging
Let’s compare splitting and merging in a BIT that tracks maximum gaps:

Scenario 1: Splitting a Gap (Inefficient)
Initial State: [0, 9] (max gap 9 at index 9).

Add obstacle at 2:

Split [0, 9] → [0, 2] (gap 2) and [2, 9] (gap 7).

BIT Updates:

Remove 9 at index 9 (not directly possible; need recomputation).

Add 2 at index 2 and 7 at index 9.

Propagate 7 upward to override 9.

Scenario 2: Merging Gaps (Efficient)
Initial State: [0, 2] (gap 2) and [2, 9] (gap 7).

Remove obstacle at 2:

Merge into [0, 9] (gap 9).

BIT Updates:

Replace 2 and 7 with 9 at index 9.

Propagate 9 upward (simple max update).

Why Reverse Processing Solves This
By processing queries in reverse:

Obstacle additions become removals, which merge gaps (larger maxima).

Merging aligns with the BIT’s strength:

Larger maxima naturally override smaller ones during propagation.

No need to track or recompute previous states.

Key Takeaway
The BIT’s design inherently favors increasing values (like merging gaps) over decreasing values (like splitting gaps). Reverse processing leverages this by converting splits into merges, avoiding costly "downgrade" operations.
