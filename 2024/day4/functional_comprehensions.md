# Generator Comprehensions vs. Nested For-Loops in Python (Functional Programming)

## Introduction

When solving grid or matrix problems in Python, a common approach is to use nested for-loops with mutation (e.g., updating a counter variable). However, functional programming encourages a declarative style using comprehensions—especially generator comprehensions—to express what you want to compute, not how to mutate state step-by-step.

This document explains the difference, advantages, and provides examples from the Day 4 solution.

## Traditional Imperative (Nested For-Loops with Mutation)

```python
total = 0
for x in range(rows):
    for y in range(cols):
        for dx, dy in steps:
            if match(grid, word, x, y, dx, dy):
                total += 1
return total
```
- **How it works:** You explicitly loop through each coordinate and direction, mutating `total` as you go.
- **Downsides:**
  - More boilerplate (setup, increment, return)
  - Easy to introduce bugs via mutation
  - Harder to reason about as logic grows

## Functional/Declarative (Generator Comprehensions)

```python
return sum(
    1
    for x in range(rows)
    for y in range(cols)
    for dx, dy in steps
    if match(grid, word, x, y, dx, dy)
)
```
- **How it works:**
  - The comprehension describes the *set of all* (x, y, dx, dy) where a match occurs.
  - `sum(1 for ...)` simply counts them, with no explicit mutation.
- **Advantages:**
  - **Declarative:** You state *what* you want, not *how* to build it step-by-step.
  - **No Mutation:** No variables are changed; the result is computed as an expression.
  - **Conciseness:** Fewer lines, less boilerplate.
  - **Composability:** Comprehensions can be easily combined, filtered, or mapped.
  - **Lazy Evaluation:** Generator comprehensions do not build intermediate lists, saving memory.

## Why Is This More Functional?
- **Immutability:** No variable is mutated; the computation is a pure expression.
- **Referential Transparency:** The result depends only on the input, not on any hidden state.
- **Composability:** You can nest or combine comprehensions with other functional tools (like `map`, `filter`).
- **Readability:** The code reads like a mathematical description of the solution.

## Example from Day 4 Solution

**Imperative:**
```python
total = 0
for i in range(len(grid)):
    for j in range(len(grid[0])):
        total += valid_number(i, j)
return total
```

**Functional:**
```python
return sum(
    valid_number(i, j)
    for i in range(len(grid))
    for j in range(len(grid[0]))
)
```

Or, for the full search:
```python
return sum(
    1
    for x in range(rows)
    for y in range(cols)
    for dx, dy in steps
    if match(grid, word, x, y, dx, dy)
)
```

## Summary Table

| Style         | Mutation | Boilerplate | Declarative | Composable | Memory Efficient |
|---------------|----------|-------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| Imperative    | Yes      | More        | No          | Less       | Sometimes       |
| Functional    | No       | Less        | Yes         | More       | Yes (generator) |

## When To Use Which?
- **Use comprehensions** when you want clarity, immutability, and concise code.
- **Use loops** when you need to break early, mutate complex state, or for very performance-critical code (though comprehensions are often just as fast).
