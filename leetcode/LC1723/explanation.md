Looking at this solution, I can help explain the branch cutting techniques used in this backtracking approach.

## Overview
This is a backtracking solution that tries to assign jobs to workers and finds the minimum possible maximum working time. The key insight is using pruning (branch cutting) to avoid exploring paths that can't lead to better solutions.

## The Two Branch Cutting Techniques:

### 1. **Duplicate State Pruning with `seen` set**
```python
seen = set() # record searched workload of workers
for i in range(k):
    if workers[i] in seen: continue # if we have searched the workload of 5, skip it.
    seen.add(workers[i])
```

**Why this works:** If multiple workers have the same current workload, assigning the current job to any of them leads to equivalent states. 

**Example:** If workers = [5, 3, 5, 0] and we're assigning job[curr] = 2:
- Assigning to worker 0 → [7, 3, 5, 0]
- Assigning to worker 2 → [5, 3, 7, 0]

These are essentially the same state (just different worker indices), so we only need to try one of them.

### 2. **Early Termination Pruning**
```python
if workers[i] + jobs[curr] >= self.res: continue # another branch cutting
```

**Why this works:** If assigning the current job to worker `i` would make their workload >= our current best result, there's no point exploring this branch further. The maximum working time can only get worse or stay the same.

**Example:** If self.res = 10 and workers[i] = 7, jobs[curr] = 4:
- workers[i] + jobs[curr] = 11 >= 10
- This assignment would already exceed our best solution, so skip it

## Visual Example

Let's trace through jobs = [3,2,3], k = 3:

```
Initial: workers = [0,0,0], res = infinity

Assign job 0 (value=3):
  → Try worker 0: [3,0,0]
    → Assign job 1 (value=2):
      → Try worker 0: [5,0,0] 
      → Try worker 1: [3,2,0] (skip worker 2 - same as worker 1)
    → Assign job 2 (value=3):
      → Complete assignments and update res
  → Skip worker 1 and 2 (same workload as worker 0)
```

## Why the commented line `jobs.sort(reverse = True)` might help:
Sorting jobs in descending order often improves pruning efficiency because:
- Larger jobs assigned early create tighter bounds
- This makes the `workers[i] + jobs[curr] >= self.res` condition more likely to trigger
- Fewer branches need to be explored

The branch cutting makes this solution much more efficient than brute force, reducing the search space significantly while still guaranteeing the optimal solution.
