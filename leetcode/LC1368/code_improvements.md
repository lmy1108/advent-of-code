I can see several issues in your solution. Let me help you understand the problems and provide guidance:

## Major Issues:

1. **Wrong data structure methods:**
   - `heapq.popleft()` doesn't exist - heapq only has `heappop()`
   - `heapq.pushleft()` doesn't exist - heapq only has `heappush()`
   - You're confusing heapq (priority queue) with deque (double-ended queue)

2. **Visited set logic error:**
   - You add `(0,0)` to visited initially, then check if `(x,y)` is in visited inside the loop
   - This will cause you to skip processing `(0,0)`

3. **Missing boundary checks:**
   - You need to check if `next_x` and `next_y` are within grid bounds

4. **Incorrect heap operations:**
   - Should be `heapq.heappush(queue, (cost, next_x, next_y))`

5. **Variable naming:**
   - Using `cost` variable that doesn't exist in the loop

## Conceptual Understanding:

This problem is perfect for **0-1 BFS** (a special case of Dijkstra's where edge weights are only 0 or 1):
- Cost 0: Moving in the direction the arrow points
- Cost 1: Moving in any other direction (changing the arrow)

Here's the corrected structure:

```python
def minCost(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    
    # Priority queue: (cost, x, y)
    pq = [(0, 0, 0)]
    
    # Direction mappings
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]  # right, left, down, up
    
    visited = set()
    
    while pq:
        cost, x, y = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        # Check if reached destination
        if x == m-1 and y == n-1:
            return cost
            
        # Skip if already visited
        if (x, y) in visited:
            continue
            
        visited.add((x, y))
        
        # Try all 4 directions
        for i, (dx, dy) in enumerate(directions):
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            
            # Check bounds
            if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                # Calculate cost
                # If direction matches grid arrow (grid[x][y] - 1 == i), cost is 0
                # Otherwise, cost is 1
                new_cost = cost + (0 if grid[x][y] - 1 == i else 1)
                heapq.heappush(pq, (new_cost, nx, ny))
    
    return -1  # Should never reach here given problem constraints
```

## Alternative: True 0-1 BFS with Deque

Since costs are only 0 or 1, you could use a deque for better performance:

```python
from collections import deque

def minCost(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Use deque: add cost-0 moves to front, cost-1 moves to back
    dq = deque([(0, 0, 0)])  # (cost, x, y)
    # ... rest of the logic
    # Use dq.appendleft() for cost-0 moves
    # Use dq.append() for cost-1 moves
```

The key insight is that this is a shortest path problem with weights 0 and 1, making it perfect for either Dijkstra's algorithm or the more efficient 0-1 BFS.
