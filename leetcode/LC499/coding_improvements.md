Sure! Here are detailed hints for each part:

## 1. **Rolling Simulation**

Instead of finding all next positions at once, simulate rolling in each direction separately:

```python
def roll_ball(maze, x, y, dx, dy, hole):
    # Start from current position
    # Keep moving in direction (dx, dy) while:
    #   - Next position is within bounds
    #   - Next position is not a wall (maze[next_x][next_y] == 0)
    # Count steps as you go
    # Check if you pass over hole during rolling
    # Return: (final_x, final_y, steps_taken, hit_hole)
```

Key points:
- Use a while loop to keep moving in one direction
- Check bounds: `0 <= next_x < m and 0 <= next_y < n`
- Stop BEFORE hitting the wall, not at the wall
- Track if you hit the hole during the roll

## 2. **Priority Queue Ordering**

For lexicographical ordering with same distances:

```python
# Instead of: heapq.heappush(pq, (x, y, dist, path))
# Use: heapq.heappush(pq, (dist, path, x, y))

# This way Python will compare by:
# 1. dist first (shortest distance)
# 2. path second (lexicographically smallest)
# 3. x, y (just for completeness, won't matter)
```

## 3. **Visited State Management**

```python
visited = set()
pq = [(0, "", ball[0], ball[1])]  # (dist, path, x, y)

while pq:
    dist, path, x, y = heapq.heappop(pq)
    
    # Check if we've visited this position
    if (x, y) in visited:
        continue
    
    # Mark as visited NOW (when processing, not when discovering)
    visited.add((x, y))
    
    # Process neighbors...
```

## 4. **Handling the Hole During Rolling**

```python
def roll_ball(maze, x, y, dx, dy, hole):
    nx, ny = x, y
    steps = 0
    
    while True:
        # Try to move one step
        next_x = nx + dx
        next_y = ny + dy
        
        # Check bounds and wall
        if not (0 <= next_x < len(maze) and 0 <= next_y < len(maze[0])):
            break
        if maze[next_x][next_y] == 1:
            break
            
        # Move to next position
        nx, ny = next_x, next_y
        steps += 1
        
        # Check if we hit the hole
        if [nx, ny] == hole:
            return nx, ny, steps, True  # Hit hole!
    
    return nx, ny, steps, False  # Didn't hit hole
```

## 5. **Complete Structure**

```python
def findShortestWay(self, maze, ball, hole):
    m, n = len(maze), len(maze[0])
    visited = set()
    
    # Priority queue: (distance, path, x, y)
    pq = [(0, "", ball[0], ball[1])]
    
    # Directions: down, left, right, up (alphabetical order!)
    directions = [(1, 0, 'd'), (0, -1, 'l'), (0, 1, 'r'), (-1, 0, 'u')]
    
    while pq:
        dist, path, x, y = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        # Check if reached hole
        if [x, y] == hole:
            return path
            
        if (x, y) in visited:
            continue
            
        visited.add((x, y))
        
        # Try all four directions
        for dx, dy, direction_char in directions:
            # Roll the ball
            new_x, new_y, steps, hit_hole = roll_ball(maze, x, y, dx, dy, hole)
            
            # Skip if no movement
            if steps == 0:
                continue
                
            # Skip if already visited
            if (new_x, new_y) in visited:
                continue
                
            # Add to priority queue
            heapq.heappush(pq, (dist + steps, path + direction_char, new_x, new_y))
    
    return "impossible"
```

The key insight is that Dijkstra's with proper ordering will naturally give you the shortest path that's also lexicographically smallest!


This solution is indeed more elegant! Let me break down the key elegant aspects:

## 1. **Generator Function for Neighbors**

```python
def neighbors(r, c):
    for dr, dc, di in [...]:
        # Rolling logic
        yield (cr, cc), di, dist
```

Using `yield` makes this a generator - it produces neighbors one at a time without storing them all in memory. This is cleaner than building and returning a list.

## 2. **Inline Rolling Logic**

```python
while (0 <= cr + dr < R and 
        0 <= cc + dc < C and
        not A[cr+dr][cc+dc]):
    cr += dr
    cc += dc
    dist += 1
    if (cr, cc) == hole:
        break
```

This elegantly combines:
- Boundary checking: `0 <= cr + dr < R and 0 <= cc + dc < C`
- Wall checking: `not A[cr+dr][cc+dc]` (since walls are 1, empty is 0)
- Hole detection: Breaking immediately when hitting the hole
- Distance counting: Incrementing `dist` with each step

## 3. **Priority Queue Structure**

```python
pq = [(0, '', ball)]  # (distance, path, position)
```

By putting distance first and path second, Python's heap automatically:
- Prioritizes by shortest distance
- Breaks ties lexicographically by path string
- No need for custom comparators!

## 4. **Clean Visited Check**

```python
if node in seen: continue
# ... process node ...
seen.add(node)
```

This pattern ensures each node is processed exactly once, which is perfect for Dijkstra's.

## 5. **Tuple Usage**

```python
ball, hole = tuple(ball), tuple(hole)
```

Converting to tuples allows them to be used in sets (since lists aren't hashable).

## 6. **Direction Order**

```python
[(-1, 0, 'u'), (0, 1, 'r'), (0, -1, 'l'), (1, 0, 'd')]
```

Notice this isn't alphabetical order ('u', 'r', 'l', 'd'), but it doesn't matter! Since the path string is compared lexicographically in the heap, the algorithm automatically chooses the right path regardless of the order we check directions.

## 7. **Unpacking Magic**

```python
for nei, di, nei_dist in neighbors(*node):
```

The `*node` unpacks the tuple, so if `node = (3, 4)`, it calls `neighbors(3, 4)`.

## 8. **Early Termination**

```python
if node == hole: return path
```

As soon as we pop the hole from the priority queue, we know we've found the shortest path (that's the guarantee of Dijkstra's algorithm).

The elegance comes from:
- Using Python's built-in features (generators, tuple unpacking, heap ordering)
- Keeping the code concise without sacrificing readability
- Letting the algorithm's properties (Dijkstra's guarantees) simplify the logic
