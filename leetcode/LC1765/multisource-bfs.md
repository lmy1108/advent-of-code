Yes, you're absolutely right! Multi-source BFS is **almost identical** to single-source BFS, with the key difference being the initialization. Let me illustrate:

## Single-Source BFS
```python
def bfs_single_source(graph, start):
    queue = deque([start])        # One starting point
    visited = {start}
    
    while queue:
        curr = queue.popleft()
        for neighbor in graph[curr]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
```

## Multi-Source BFS
```python
def bfs_multi_source(graph, sources):
    queue = deque(sources)        # Multiple starting points
    visited = set(sources)        # Mark all sources as visited
    
    while queue:
        curr = queue.popleft()
        for neighbor in graph[curr]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
```

**The core BFS logic is IDENTICAL!** The only differences are:
1. Initialize queue with multiple sources instead of one
2. Mark all sources as visited initially

## The Conceptual Trick

Multi-source BFS is equivalent to:
- Adding a "super source" node
- Connecting it to all actual sources with 0-weight edges
- Running single-source BFS from the super source

```
Super Source
    / | \
   0  0  0    (0-weight edges)
  /   |   \
S1   S2   S3  (actual sources)
```

## Why This Works

BFS explores nodes in order of distance. When you start with multiple sources:
- Distance 0: All source nodes
- Distance 1: All nodes reachable in 1 step from ANY source
- Distance 2: All nodes reachable in 2 steps from ANY source
- etc.

## Practical Benefits

```python
# Instead of:
min_dist = float('inf')
for source in sources:
    dist = bfs_from(source, target)
    min_dist = min(min_dist, dist)

# You can do:
distances = multi_source_bfs(sources)
min_dist = distances[target]
```

## Common Patterns Are Identical

Whether single or multi-source:
- Use visited set/array
- Process FIFO
- Same neighbor checking
- Same distance tracking

So yes, your understanding is correct - it's the **same algorithm**, just with a different starting condition. This elegant simplicity is what makes multi-source BFS so powerful!
