Looking at your code, I can see several issues that need to be fixed:

1. **Incorrect approach**: Your code is generating permutations (where order matters) rather than combinations (where order doesn't matter). This will produce duplicates like `[1,2]` and `[2,1]`.

2. **Inefficiency**: Using `sum(visited)` is O(n) for each check, which is unnecessary.

3. **Missing optimization**: For combinations, once you've chosen a number, you should only consider numbers greater than it to avoid duplicates.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def combine(self, n: int, k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        
        def dfs(start, cur):
            # Base case: we've selected k numbers
            if len(cur) == k:
                res.append(cur[:])
                return
            
            # Try each number from start to n
            for i in range(start, n + 1):
                cur.append(i)
                dfs(i + 1, cur)  # Next number must be greater than i
                cur.pop()
        
        dfs(1, [])
        return res
```

Key changes:
1. **Removed `visited` array**: Not needed for combinations
2. **Added `start` parameter**: Ensures we only consider numbers greater than the last selected number
3. **Changed loop**: Each recursive call starts from `i + 1`, preventing duplicates
4. **Simpler base case**: Check `len(cur) == k` instead of summing the visited array

**Why this works for combinations:**
- By always moving forward (using `start`), we ensure `[1,2]` is generated but `[2,1]` is not
- This naturally generates all C(n,k) combinations without duplicates

**Optimized version with pruning:**

```python
class Solution:
    def combine(self, n: int, k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        
        def dfs(start, cur):
            if len(cur) == k:
                res.append(cur[:])
                return
            
            # Pruning: need at least k - len(cur) more numbers
            # So we can stop at n - (k - len(cur)) + 1
            for i in range(start, n - (k - len(cur)) + 2):
                cur.append(i)
                dfs(i + 1, cur)
                cur.pop()
        
        dfs(1, [])
        return res
```

This optimization stops early when there aren't enough numbers left to form a valid combination.

**Alternative iterative approach using the previous combination:**

```python
class Solution:
    def combine(self, n: int, k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Start with all combinations of size 0 (empty set)
        combs = [[]]
        
        for _ in range(k):
            new_combs = []
            for comb in combs:
                # Start from the next number after the last in current combination
                start = comb[-1] + 1 if comb else 1
                for i in range(start, n + 1):
                    new_combs.append(comb + [i])
            combs = new_combs
        
        return combs
```

The recursive backtracking approach is generally preferred for this problem as it's more intuitive and memory-efficient.
